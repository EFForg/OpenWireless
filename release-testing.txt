Testing tasks before releasing a new firmware:

1. ./run-tests.sh
2. Install on router, run through setup process (set password, set SSID)
3. Log out of web UI, visit https://gw.home.lan/dashboard.html. Verify redirects
     to login page.
4. Log in again, verify goes to dashboard and dashboard shows reasonable numbers
     and refreshes periodically.
5. Install SSH key, log in via SSH.
6. Access the openwireless.org network, load a web site. Make sure the admin website is 
     not accesible from openwireless.org.
7. Click the circular "Check for update" button at bottom of dashboard page and verify 
     that pop up box appears. Then refresh dashboard to check that the last checked 
     date next to button updates to the current time. TODO in future the last checked 
     time should auto update without having to refresh dashboard page. 
8. On settings page change upload/download speeds, openwireless.org limits. Refresh
     settings page and check the changes are retained. 
9. Turn off and on openwireless.org network. Verify SSID disappears and reappears.
