# OpenWireless Is No Longer Being Maintained

In 2014, EFF began the OpenWireless firmware project as a direct, simple and scalable way to deploy high-quality open router firmware.

Unfortunately, as detailed in this blog post <https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/toward-better-open-wireless-routers>, weâ€™ve encountereed some significant obstacles to direct deployment. We may find a way to overcome those obstacles but, in the meantime, EFF has ceased maintaining the OpenWireless firmware project.

You can still clone this repository if you wish to, and use the code however you like consistent with the Apache 2.0 license (see https://github.com/EFForg/OpenWireless/blob/master/LICENSE).

If you are interested in actively maintaining this project, feel free to reach out to EFF <https://www.eff.org/contact>. Please note, however, that we don't currently have the resources to provide further support.
