# Since lighttpd and therefore the Python routerapi runs as www-data,
# it needs to be able to read /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys to know
# whether SSH has been enabled. /etc/rc.d/S50dropbear sets the directory to 0700
# but this is excessive. The host keys need to be rw-------, and they are
# already. /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys can be world-readable since it contains
# public keys.
